# Python project


We have decided to focus on a movie analysis as we both watch movies often and therefore we were interested in the fact how the most famous movie databases work from inside out. We were following the procedure of web scraping and implementing it on both the CSDF and IMDB databases. We considered reasonable number of top movies from both websites and looked for the differences between them.

The biggest obstacle was to compare the number of votes quantitatively as on CSFD there is no particular number of votes given. There is just number of fans instead, which does not correspond to the total number of reviews. Because of that, we were forced to rely particularly on movie ratings - on IMDB, the movie rating is stated in two measures - basic 10-scale rating and also metascore obtained from professional movie critics. On CSFD, the movie rating is stated in one measure in percent.
